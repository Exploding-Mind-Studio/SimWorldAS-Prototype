SimWorld24 - A Simulation Game in Development - by Exploding Mind Studio (c) 2024

# Overview

WHAT is it?

The project with the working title "SimWorld ANTHROPOSPHERE" aims to design and implement a computer game around simulating the historic evolution of human cultures on planet earth.



WHY are we doing it?

We are building a game that we would like to play, that does not exist in this form.

We are trying to demonstrate a new form of illustrating and understanding complex systems and the wicked social problems that arise  out of them, in the hopes that future leaders may be inspired by this way of interpreting the world.

For the intellectual challenge to do something most people respond to with "it cannot be done".



HOW are we going about it?

Using inspirations from complexity theory, agent-based modeling & simulation methods, and traditional large scale open world game mechanics and god game genre.

Developing a piece of software that can be distributed as game, with an engaging user experience.

Using a novel implementation paradigm dubbed "scaling fractal complexity", useful to always scope-complete iterative releases with incrementally growing depth.
