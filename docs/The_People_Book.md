### Overview ###
People are the simulated humans, both the individual persons, characters, as well as their collectives, such as tribes/societies.
Just as any other SimEntity in SimWorld, the simulated entity of a "SimPerson" is implemented with Identity, Structure, Properties, Behavior, and Interfaces.

### Individuals ###
People as individuals have a life cycle, metabolism, and pursuits (desires, goals, aspirations, preferences), traits, (dis)abilities, (learned or innate) skills, connections (social, to other people), identity, heritage.

### Collectives ###
Individual people tend to connect to each other, like as family bands, tribes, clans, or based on shared interests, missions, destinies/fates (living in the same area, under the same conditions).

### Cultures ###
Culture is about the collective behavior and identity of a collective of people.
Distinct cultures emerge, amongst different bands/societies of people.

### Civilization ###
Social institutions and physical infrastructure as manifestation of societies & cultures.
